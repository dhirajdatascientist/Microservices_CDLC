## Answers

```
1. What is a Microservice? 
   - A small, independent program that does one specific job.

2. Why would you use Microservices instead of one big program? 
   - Easier to manage, update, and scale.

3. Can you name a tool that helps run Microservices? 
   - Docker etc.

4. How do Microservices talk to each other? 
   - Through APIs.

5. What is an API? 
   - A way for programs to communicate with each other.

6. Why are small services easier to manage? 
   - Less complex and can be updated individually.

7. Can each Microservice use its own database? 
   - Yes, they can.

8. What is Docker? 
   - A tool that packages and runs software in containers.

9. Why is it important to test each Microservice? 
   - To make sure it works correctly.

10. How do you know if a Microservice is not working properly? 
   - Monitoring tools can alert you to problems.

11. Can different Microservices be written in different programming languages? 
   - Yes, they can.

12. What does "scaling" a Microservice mean? 
   - Increasing its capacity to handle more work.

13. Why might teams choose to update one Microservice at a time? 
   - To reduce risks and ensure the system remains stable.

14. What is meant by "service independence"? 
   - Each service can operate and be updated on its own.

15. How can Microservices help make applications more resilient? 
   - If one fails, the others can still work.

16. What is a "monolithic" application? 
   - A single, large program where everything is interconnected.

17. Why is security important in Microservices? 
   - To protect data and ensure the system is safe.

18. What happens if one Microservice fails? 
   - Other services can still run, but some features might be unavailable.

19. How do Microservices help with faster software delivery? 
   - Teams can work on and release different services independently.

20. Why is it useful to put a Microservice in a container? 
   - It ensures the service runs the same way everywhere.
